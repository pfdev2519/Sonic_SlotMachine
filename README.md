# Simple Slot Game - Casino Night (Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Theme)

This project is a simple slot game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is based on the "Casino Night" theme from the classic video game _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_. The goal of the game is to simulate a casino slot machine experience using a retro Sonic aesthetic.

## Features

- **Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Theme**: A vibrant Casino Night theme with colors, fonts, and images inspired by the classic Sonic game.
- **Slot Machine Mechanics**: Randomized slot results that mimic the feeling of a real casino slot game.
- **User Interface**: Clean and simple UI with easy-to-use controls for spinning the slot machine.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling the page, including animations and transitions for the slot machine.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including the randomization of slot outcomes and event handling.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Spin" button to start the slot machine.
2. **Winning Condition**: If three matching icons appear on the slot reels, you win the round.
3. **Coin System**: The game uses a virtual coin system. You'll start with a set number of coins, and each spin costs a certain amount. Winning the game rewards you with additional coins.

## Slot Machine Design

* The slot machine consists of three reels, each with icons such as:

  * **Sonic Coins**
  * **Rings**
  * **Chaos Emeralds**
* Reels randomly display these icons on each spin, with sound effects triggered when you win.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the game by:

* **Changing the theme**: Swap out the Sonic images and sounds for a different theme.
* **Adjusting the probabilities**: Tweak the randomness to change how frequently certain items appear.
* **Adding more functionality**: You could add a high score tracker, different spin animations, or more complex betting mechanics.

## Known Issues

* Mobile responsiveness: The game works better on desktop screens. A responsive version for mobile devices is a future goal.
* Minor sound delay: On slower devices, sound effects may have a slight delay.
